# HyperMedia-project-Bernat-L-pez

I made this website for two knid of people, the first one is the teacher, I used many of the things we have learned to show the knowledge they have taught me.
The second type of person is for small busines owners that know about UdG, that's why I used these colors and the picture is me with Xoriguers.

Information Architecture:
I took inspiration from my real CV, the header and the navigation are mostly to show that I know how to used what we had been taught these last days.
The navigation is there so it's easier to find the information you are most interested in. 
The body is split in two parts, the personal one on the left and the general one on the right. 
The personal one has a blue background to make me apear a closer person, the content consists in a picture of me, a little description, my contact information with icons to make it more apealing, I tried to find 3 icons with colour, but I couldn't find any matching ones so I just went for black icons and finally I made a table with all the languages I speak and to what level I speak them.
The general part starts with my work experience and one of the things we learned is a selector so I made one where you can select the type of experience you are most interested in, when you select the one of the jobs I had, there's a JS file that makes the text change and information shows.
The rest of the general part it just shows my academic training and the time I spent doing it and finally my skills and interests.

Visual Design:
I decided to split both the personal and general part to divide my personal side from my professional side, however I wanted for them to have the same importance that's why I put them side by side using flexbox.
The colors used in the web are the ones also used by the UdG, as a student of this university and member of Xoriguers, I feel that this colors represent me better than any other colors and makes people who already know about UdG find this web familiar with the institution, I wanted to use yellow and more light blue because that is the colors of Xoriguers, but I found that it made the web informal and unprofessional, so I went with more pale colors like grey and white and darker blue.
For the titles like my name or "Formaci√≥ Academica", I used a font that I feel it's formal (Platino), but I though that I couldn't use this one for long texts, that's why I used Arial, it may not seem that formal or professional but it's more apealing as a reader to have long texts as Arial rather than Platino.
A feature I made is the fact that you can choose what job that I did you want to know about, I used JS for that and it was just to show to the teacher that I know how to use it.
